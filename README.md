# React Native Testing

## Integration Testing

- multiple units working together
- Testing `UserInfo.js`
- `UserInfo-test.js`
- can Still use SnapShots, same as jest test renderer
- Snapshots are useful for navigating and searching
- Each UserItem is just a View object, Looks the same as any other
- Need to add an `accessibilityLabel` to each item. Good practice
- SnapShots can handle the static content. We are more concerner with state behavior
